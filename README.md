Introduction
-------------
This is not a code repository because Greenfoot doesn't work well with VCS, but a link to my Greenfoot project.
Click here for a [link to my project](http://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/642) (a Java applet).

This is a Breakout game I created in Java with the Greenfoot IDE, a learning tool for Java that provides a simple graphics library.  Press run to start the game.

Breakout is a game where you move your paddle to bounce a ball off of it.  Don't let the ball fall under your paddle! 
This project was one of my first programming projects.

Source code is available upon request.
